# Idiot's Guide to Task Lifecycle Dashboard

## What This Thing Actually Does

This dashboard shows you how your tasks move through different stages - like a conveyor belt for work items. Think of it as watching your to-do list items travel from "I need to do this" all the way to "Done!"

## The Big Picture

### Task Lifecycle States
Your tasks go through these stages (in order):
1. **Created** - Someone made a new task
2. **In Progress** - Someone is working on it
3. **Review** - Someone is checking the work
4. **Done** - It's finished!

### What You'll See on the Dashboard
- **Flow Chart** - Visual arrows showing how tasks move between stages
- **Numbers** - How many tasks are in each stage right now
- **Time Tracking** - How long tasks spend in each stage
- **Bottlenecks** - Where tasks get stuck (shown in red)

## Using the Dashboard (Step by Step)

### Opening the Dashboard
1. Go to your browser
2. Type in the URL your admin gave you
3. Log in with your username and password
4. Click "Task Dashboard" or "Lifecycle View"

### Reading the Main View

#### The Flow Diagram
- **Boxes** = Different stages of work
- **Arrows** = How tasks move between stages
- **Numbers in boxes** = How many tasks are currently in that stage
- **Colors**:
  - Green = Everything's moving well
  - Yellow = Starting to back up
  - Red = Houston, we have a problem

#### The Task Counter
- Shows exact numbers: "5 tasks in Progress, 3 in Review"
- Updates in real-time (refreshes every 30 seconds)

#### Average Time Display
- "Tasks spend 2.5 days in Review on average"
- Helps you know what's normal vs. what's slow

### Filtering Your View

1. Click the "Team" dropdown
2. Select your team name
3. Now you only see your team's tasks

3. Click "Apply"
4. Shows only tasks from that time period

#### By Priority
1. Click "Priority" filter
2. Choose High, Medium, or Low
3. See only tasks with that priority level

### Understanding the Reports

#### Daily Flow Report
- Shows how many tasks moved between stages each day
- Good for seeing productivity trends
- "Yesterday we completed 15 tasks, today only 8"

#### Bottleneck Alert
- Red warnings when too many tasks pile up in one stage
- "WARNING: 20 tasks stuck in Review stage"
- Click the warning to see which specific tasks

#### Team Performance
- Compare different teams side-by-side
- See who's faster at different stages
- Not for punishment - for learning best practices!

## Common Problems and Solutions

### "I Don't See Any Data"
**Problem**: Dashboard is blank or shows zero tasks
**Solutions**:
- Check if you selected the right date range
- Make sure your team filter isn't too narrow
- Ask admin if you have the right permissions
- Try refreshing the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)

### "Numbers Don't Look Right"
**Problem**: The counts seem wrong
**Solutions**:
- Wait 30 seconds for auto-refresh
- Check if tasks were recently moved to different projects
- Verify you're looking at the right time period
- Ask a coworker if their numbers match yours

### "Everything is Red/Showing Bottlenecks"
**Problem**: All stages show as blocked
**Solutions**:
- This might be accurate - you really do have bottlenecks
- Check if it's end of sprint/deadline crunch time
- Look at individual task details to understand why
- Bring this up in your next team meeting

### "I Can't Find My Tasks"
**Problem**: Your tasks aren't showing up
**Solutions**:
- Check all filter settings (team, date, priority)
- Make sure tasks are properly assigned to you in the system
- Verify tasks are in the right project
- Contact admin to check your user permissions
