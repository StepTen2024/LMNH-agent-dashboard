# Troubleshooting Guide - Task Lifecycle Dashboard

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Dashboard Won't Load

**Problem**: The dashboard page shows a blank screen or loading spinner that never completes.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the backend server is running
   - Look for the server process on port 8080
   - Restart the server if needed
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies
3. Try opening in an incognito/private browser window
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 â†’ Console tab)

### Tasks Not Showing Up

**Problem**: The task list is empty even though you know tasks exist.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify database connection
   - Check database server status
   - Confirm connection credentials
2. Check API endpoints are responding
   - Test `/api/tasks` endpoint directly
3. Verify user permissions
   - Ensure logged-in user has access to view tasks
4. Check filter settings
   - Reset any active filters on the dashboard

### Task Status Not Updating

**Problem**: Task status changes aren't reflected in the dashboard.

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the page manually
2. Check if real-time updates are enabled
   - Look for WebSocket connection errors in console
3. Verify background jobs are running
   - Check task queue processing
4. Clear application cache

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Dashboard loads slowly or becomes unresponsive.

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce the number of tasks displayed
   - Use date ranges or filters
   - Enable pagination
2. Check database query performance
   - Look for slow query logs
3. Increase browser memory
   - Close other tabs/applications
4. Check network connectivity

### Authentication Problems

**Problem**: Can't log in or session keeps expiring.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify username and password
2. Check if account is locked or expired
3. Clear browser cookies for the site
4. Confirm authentication service is running
5. Check session timeout settings

### Data Not Saving

**Problem**: Changes to tasks don't persist after page refresh.

**Solutions**:
1. Check form validation errors
   - Look for red error messages
2. Verify database write permissions
3. Check API endpoint responses for errors
4. Ensure required fields are filled
5. Check for JavaScript errors preventing form submission

### Charts and Graphs Not Displaying

**Problem**: Dashboard charts show empty or broken.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if chart library is loaded
   - Look for 404 errors for chart.js or similar
2. Verify data format is correct
   - Charts need proper JSON structure
3. Check browser compatibility
   - Update to latest browser version
4. Disable ad blockers temporarily

### Export/Import Issues

**Problem**: Can't export data or import fails.

**Solutions**:
1. Check file permissions
   - Ensure write access to export directory
2. Verify file format compatibility
   - Use supported formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
3. Check file size limits
   - Large files may need to be split
4. Ensure proper file encoding (UTF-8)

### Search Not Working

**Problem**: Search function returns no results or errors.

**Solutions**:
1. Check search index status
   - Rebuild search index if needed
2. Verify search syntax
   - Use exact matches first
3. Check database connectivity
4. Clear search filters and try again
