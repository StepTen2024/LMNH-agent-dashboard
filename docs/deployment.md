# Idiot's Guide: Task Lifecycle Dashboard Deployment

## What This Thing Does

This dashboard shows you how tasks move through different stages - like a conveyor belt for work items. Think of it as a visual way to see where your tasks are stuck, moving, or completed.

## Before You Start (Prerequisites)

You need these things installed on your computer:
- Node.js (version 14 or newer) - this runs JavaScript on your computer
- npm (comes with Node.js) - this installs packages
- Git - this downloads code from the internet
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### How to Check if You Have These:

Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
```
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

If you see version numbers, you're good. If you see "command not found" or similar, you need to install that thing.

## Step 1: Get the Code

1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to where you want the project folder:
   ```
   cd Desktop
   ```
3. Download the code:
   ```
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd task-lifecycle-dashboard
   ```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Think of dependencies as the ingredients needed to bake a cake. Run this command:

```
npm install
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder with lots of files. This is normal and expected.

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Environment variables are like secret settings for your app.

1. Look for a file called `.env.example` in your project folder
2. Copy it and rename the copy to `.env`
3. Open the `.env` file in any text editor
4. Fill in the values that look like `YOUR_VALUE_HERE`

Example `.env` file might look like:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Step 4: Set Up the Database

If your app uses a database (it probably does):

1. Make sure your database server is running (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
2. Create a new database for this project
3. Run the database setup command:
   ```
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm run setup
   ```

## Step 5: Start the Application

### For Development (when you're testing/building):
```
npm run dev
```

### For Production (when it's live for real users):
```
npm run build
npm start
```

## Step 6: Open in Your Browser

1. Wait for the terminal to show something like "Server running on port 3000"
2. Open your web browser
3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
4. You should see your dashboard!

## Common Problems and Solutions

### "Port already in use" error
Someone else is using port 3000. Either:
- Kill the other process using that port
- Change the PORT in your `.env` file to something like 3001

### "Module not found" errors
You're missing some packages. Run:
```
npm install
```

### "Database connection failed"
- Check your database server is running
- Verify your DATABASE_URL in the `.env` file is correct
- Make sure the database exists

### Page shows error or blank screen
1. Check the terminal for error messages
2. Open browser developer tools (F12) and look at the Console tab
3. Make sure you completed all the setup steps

### "Command not found" errors
You're missing a prerequisite. Go back to the "Before You Start" section.

## Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Simple VPS/Server Deployment

1. Get a server (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, etc.)
2. Install Node.js and npm on the server
3. Upload your code using git or file transfer
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Set up environment variables
6. Run: `npm run build && npm start`
7. Use PM2 to keep it running: `npm install -g pm2 && pm2 start npm --start`

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

If you have a `Dockerfile` in your project:

1. Build the image: `docker build -t task-dashboard .`
2. Run the container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 task-dashboard`

### Option 3: Platform-as-a-Service (Easy Button)

Deploy to services like:
- Heroku
- Vercel  
- Netlify
- Railway

These usually just need you to connect your Git repository and they handle the rest.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check if it's working:
Visit your dashboard URL regularly to make sure it loads.

### Check logs for errors:
- Development: Look at your terminal
- Production: Check your server logs or use `pm2 logs`

### Update the application:
1. Pull latest code: `git pull`
2. Install any new dependencies: `npm install`
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`
4. Restart: `pm2 restart all` or restart your server

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production (not http://)
- [ ] Keep your `.env` file secret (never commit it to git)
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly: `npm audit fix`
- [ ] Use a reverse proxy like nginx in production
- [ ] Enable firewall on your server
- [ ] Backup your database regularly

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check the project's README.md file
3. Look at the browser's developer console (F12)
4. Search for the exact error message on Google
5. Check the project's GitHub issues page
6. Ask on Stack Overflow or relevant forums

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Install packages
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Update packages
npm update

# View running processes (if using PM2)
pm2 status

# View logs (if using PM2)
pm2 logs
```

Remember: If something breaks, don't panic. Read the error message, google it, and try again. Most problems have been solved by someone else before you!
