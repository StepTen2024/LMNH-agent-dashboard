# Idiot's Guide to Task Lifecycle Dashboard FAQ

## What is the Task Lifecycle Dashboard?

The Task Lifecycle Dashboard is a simple web application that helps you track tasks as they move through different stages of completion. Think of it like a digital kanban board where you can see all your tasks organized by their current status.

## Basic Concepts

### What is a "task lifecycle"?
A task lifecycle is just fancy talk for "the journey a task takes from start to finish." In this dashboard, tasks typically go through stages like:
- **To Do** - Tasks you haven't started yet
- **In Progress** - Tasks you're currently working on
- **Done** - Completed tasks

### What are "stages" or "statuses"?
These are simply categories that tell you what state your task is in. Like folders for organizing your tasks.

## Getting Started

### How do I add a new task?
1. Look for an "Add Task" or "+" button (usually at the top of the screen)
2. Type in what you need to do
3. Choose which stage/status it should start in (usually "To Do")
4. Click "Save" or "Add"

### How do I move a task to a different stage?
Most dashboards let you either:
- **Drag and drop**: Click on the task and drag it to the column you want
- **Click to edit**: Click on the task, then change its status from a dropdown menu

### How do I mark a task as complete?
Move the task to the "Done" or "Completed" column/status.

## Common Questions

### Why can't I see my tasks?
- Check if you're looking in the right status column
- Make sure you've actually added tasks to the dashboard
- Try refreshing the page

### I accidentally deleted a task. Can I get it back?
This depends on your specific dashboard. Some have:
- An "undo" button (look for it right after you delete)
- A "trash" or "deleted items" section
- A revision history feature

If none of these exist, you'll need to recreate the task.

### Can I edit a task after I've created it?
Usually yes! Try:
- Double-clicking on the task
- Right-clicking for a menu
- Looking for an "edit" or pencil icon

### How do I organize tasks by priority?
Common ways include:
- Adding priority labels (High, Medium, Low)
- Using colors (red for urgent, yellow for medium, green for low)
- Putting high-priority tasks at the top of each column

### Can multiple people use the same dashboard?
This depends on your specific dashboard setup. Some are:
- **Personal only** - just for you
- **Shared** - multiple people can view and edit
- **Team-based** - different permissions for different people

## Troubleshooting

### The dashboard is loading slowly
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory

### I can't drag and drop tasks
- Make sure you're clicking and holding on the task itself
- Try using the edit menu instead of dragging
- Check if drag-and-drop is disabled in your browser

### Tasks aren't saving
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you're clicking "Save" after making changes
- Try logging out and back in

### The dashboard looks weird or broken
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear your browser cache
- Try a different browser

## Tips for Success

### Keep task names short but descriptive
- **Good**: "Fix login bug on homepage"
- **Bad**: "Fix bug" or "Update the user authentication system to resolve the issue where users cannot log in from the main homepage due to session timeout problems"

### Don't create too many stages
Start with just 3-4 stages like "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Done". You can add more later if needed.

### Review regularly
Check your dashboard daily and move tasks along. Stale tasks in "In Progress" are usually a sign something is stuck.

### Use consistent naming
If you're working with a team, agree on how to name and organize things so everyone understands.

## Still Confused?

### What if I need help with something not covered here?
1. Look for a "Help" or "?" button in the dashboard itself
2. Check if there are video tutorials available
3. Ask a colleague who's used similar tools
4. Contact your IT support if this is a work tool

### Should I backup my tasks?
If your tasks are important, yes! Some ways to backup:
- Export to a file (look for "Export" in settings)
- Take screenshots of important boards
- Keep a separate list of critical tasks elsewhere

Remember: This is just a tool to help you organize work. Don't spend more time managing the dashboard than actually doing the tasks!
