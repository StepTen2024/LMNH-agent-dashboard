# Idiot's Guide to Task Lifecycle Dashboard

## What is this thing?

The Task Lifecycle Dashboard is a web application that shows you how your tasks move through different stages - from when they're created to when they're completed. Think of it like watching your to-do items travel through a pipeline.

## Getting Started (The Really Easy Way)

### Step 1: Open the Dashboard
1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari - whatever you use)
2. Go to the dashboard URL (ask your IT person for this)
3. You should see a page with charts and graphs

### Step 2: Understanding What You're Looking At

When you first open the dashboard, you'll see several sections:

**Top Section - Summary Numbers**
- Total Tasks: How many tasks exist in total
- Active Tasks: Tasks currently being worked on
- Completed Tasks: Tasks that are done
- Overdue Tasks: Tasks that missed their deadline (these are bad)

**Middle Section - Charts**
- Task Flow Chart: Shows how tasks move between stages
- Timeline Chart: Shows when tasks were created and completed
- Status Pie Chart: Visual breakdown of task statuses

**Bottom Section - Task List**
- A table showing all your tasks with details

## How to Use Each Feature

### Filtering Tasks (Finding Specific Tasks)

**By Date:**
1. Look for the date picker boxes (usually at the top)
2. Click the "From" date box
3. Pick your start date from the calendar
4. Click the "To" date box  
5. Pick your end date
6. Click "Apply" or "Filter"

**By Status:**
1. Find the dropdown menu labeled "Status" or "Filter by Status"
2. Click it to see options like:
   - All
   - Not Started
   - In Progress
   - Completed
   - On Hold
3. Click the status you want to see
4. The dashboard updates automatically

**By Team or Person:**
1. Look for "Assignee" or "Team" dropdown
2. Click it to see a list of people or teams
3. Select who you want to filter by
4. Dashboard updates to show only their tasks

### Reading the Charts

**Task Flow Chart (The Confusing Looking One):**
- Shows boxes connected by arrows
- Each box = a stage in your process (like "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Done")
- Numbers on arrows = how many tasks moved between stages
- Thicker arrows = more tasks moved that way

**Timeline Chart:**
- Horizontal bars showing task duration
- Left side = when task started
- Right side = when task ended (or current date if still ongoing)
- Different colors = different statuses or priorities

**Pie Chart:**
- Circle divided into colored slices
- Each slice = percentage of tasks in that status
- Bigger slice = more tasks in that status

### Task List Table

The table at the bottom shows detailed information:

**Columns you'll see:**
- Task ID: Unique number for each task
- Title: What the task is about
- Status: Current stage of the task
- Assignee: Who's working on it
- Created Date: When it was made
- Due Date: When it should be finished
- Priority: How important it is (High, Medium, Low)

**Sorting the table:**
- Click any column header to sort by that column
- Click again to reverse the order

**Searching in the table:**
- Look for a search box above the table
- Type anything (task name, person's name, etc.)
- Table filters to show matching results

### Exporting Data (Getting Info Out)

1. Look for an "Export" button (usually top-right)
2. Click it
3. Choose format:
   - CSV: Opens in Excel/Google Sheets
   - PDF: Creates a report document
   - PNG/JPG: Saves charts as images
4. File downloads to your computer

## Common Tasks (What Most People Want to Do)

### "Show me all overdue tasks"
1. Find the Status filter
2. Select "Overdue" 
3. Or look for tasks where Due Date is red/highlighted

### "Show me what John is working on"
1. Use the Assignee filter
2. Select "John" from dropdown
3. Table shows only John's tasks

### "Show me this week's completed tasks"

3. View the results
