# 🎨 Avatar System - Dynamic SVG Characters

## Overview
Added **dynamic SVG avatars** that change based on context and mood!

## Features

### 👤 User Avatar
- Simple human character **with hands** (because they have them! 😄)
- Blue theme to contrast with LMNH green
- Shows "HUMAN" label at bottom
- Fixed design - doesn't change

### 🚴‍♂️ LMNH Avatar - Dynamic Moods!
LMNH's avatar **changes** based on what he's saying or doing:

1. **Confident** (default)
   - Classic smirk
   - Arms spread wide (NO HANDS!)
   - Ready to code

2. **Thinking** 🤔
   - Neutral mouth
   - Thought bubbles floating
   - Pondering something

3. **Coding** 💻
   - Square "glasses" eyes with `<>` and `{}` symbols
   - Focused expression
   - Extra code symbols around
   - "git" and "AI" text

4. **Excited** 🎉
   - Big smile!
   - Sparkles around eyes
   - Arms raised in celebration!

5. **Confused** ❓
   - Wavy mouth
   - One eye slightly bigger
   - Question mark floating

6. **Working** ⚙️
   - Similar to coding
   - Determined look

## How It Works

### Auto-Detection
LMNH's mood is **automatically detected** from message content:

```typescript
// Keywords trigger different moods
- "!" + "awesome/amazing/love" → excited
- "thinking/hmm/let me" → thinking
- "code/function/git/commit" → coding
- "working/building/fixing" → working
- "?/not sure/confused" → confused
- default → confident
```

### Usage in Chat
```tsx
<LMNHAvatar mood="excited" />  // Specific mood
<LMNHAvatar />                  // Default confident
<UserAvatar />                  // User (fixed design)
```

## Technical Details

### Files
- `components/avatars/UserAvatar.tsx` - Human avatar
- `components/avatars/LMNHAvatar.tsx` - Dynamic LMNH avatar
- `components/ChatModal.tsx` - Integrated into chat

### Avatar Features
- Pure SVG (no external images!)
- 40x40px size (configurable)
- Inline rendering (fast!)
- Maintains consistent theme (#00ff88 for LMNH, #4A90E2 for user)

## Examples

When LMNH says:
- "I'm so excited to code this! 🎉" → **excited** mood (arms up!)
- "Hmm, let me think about that..." → **thinking** mood (thought bubbles)
- "I'm working on fixing that bug" → **working** mood (focused)
- "Just committed the code to git!" → **coding** mood (code symbols)
- "Not sure about that?" → **confused** mood (question mark)

## Result
✅ Chat messages now have **personality**!
✅ LMNH's avatar **matches his mood**!
✅ User has distinct avatar (with hands lol)
✅ All pure SVG - fast and scalable!
