# Contributing to Task Lifecycle Dashboard

## The Idiot's Guide to Contributing

This guide assumes you know nothing about this project and will walk you through everything step by step.

## What is This Project?

The Task Lifecycle Dashboard is a web application that helps teams track tasks from creation to completion. Think of it like a digital kanban board with extra features for monitoring task health and progress.

## Getting Started (For Complete Beginners)

### What You Need Before Starting

1. **Git** - Version control software
   - Windows: Download from https://git-scm.com/
   - Mac: Install via Homebrew `brew install git` or download from website
   - Linux: `sudo apt install git` or `sudo yum install git`

2. **Node.js and npm** - JavaScript runtime and package manager
   - Download from https://nodejs.org/ (get the LTS version)
   - This installs both Node.js and npm together

3. **A Code Editor**
   - VS Code (recommended): https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Or any text editor you prefer

4. **A GitHub Account**
   - Sign up at https://github.com/ if you don't have one

### Step 1: Get the Code on Your Computer

1. **Fork the repository** (make your own copy)
   - Go to the project's GitHub page
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right
   - This creates a copy under your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork** (download it to your computer)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/task-lifecycle-dashboard.git
   cd task-lifecycle-dashboard
   ```
   Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username

### Step 2: Set Up the Project

1. **Install dependencies** (download all the required packages)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This might take a few minutes the first time

2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000

3. **Verify it works**
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - You should see the Task Lifecycle Dashboard

## How to Make Changes

### The Basic Workflow (Do This Every Time)

1. **Create a new branch** for your changes
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-name
   ```
   Replace `my-feature-name` with something descriptive like `fix-login-bug` or `add-dark-mode`

2. **Make your changes** using your code editor

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Save your changes** to git
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of what you changed"
   ```

5. **Push your changes** to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Fill out the template
   - Click "Create pull request"

## Coding Standards (The Rules)

### Code Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings: `'hello'` not `"hello"`
- Name variables clearly: `userEmail` not `ue`

### Git Commit Messages
Write clear commit messages:
- ‚úÖ Good: `"Fix login validation for empty emails"`
- ‚ùå Bad: `"fixed stuff"`

### React Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small (under 200 lines if possible)
- Put components in their own files
- Use descriptive names: `TaskCard.jsx` not `Card.jsx`

## Testing Your Changes

### Before Submitting
Always run these commands:

```bash
# Check for code style issues
npm run lint

# Run automated tests
npm test

# Build the project to catch errors
npm run build

# Test in your browser
npm run dev
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Does the app still start without errors?
- [ ] Do existing features still work?
- [ ] Does your new feature work as expected?
- [ ] Does it work on mobile screens?
- [ ] Are there any console errors?

## Getting Help

### If You're Stuck
1. **Check existing issues** - Someone might have had the same problem
2. **Read the error message** - It usually tells you what's wrong
3. **Ask for help** - Create a GitHub issue with the "question" label
4. **Join our discussions** - Use GitHub Discussions for general questions

### Common Problems and Solutions

**Problem**: `npm install` fails
**Solution**: Delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again

**Problem**: Port 3000 already in use
**Solution**: Kill other processes using port 3000, or use `npm run dev -- --port 3001`

**Problem**: Git says "permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure you're pushing to your fork, not the original repository

**Problem**: Tests are failing
**Solution**: Run `npm test` to see what's failing, fix the issues, then run again

## Pull Request Process

## Project Structure Deep Dive

### Component Organization
```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                    # Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forms/                 # Form-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ charts/                # Data visualization components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/                # Page layout components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ features/              # Feature-specific components
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/
```

### State Management
- We use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
- Context API for shared state
- Local storage for persistence

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS for utility classes
- CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

## Security Guidelines

### What NOT to Commit
- API keys or secrets
- Personal information
- Large files (over 100MB)
- node_modules directory
- .env files with real credentials

### Safe Practices
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Sanitize user input
- Keep dependencies updated
- Don't hardcode sensitive data

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
- Use dynamic imports for large components
- Lazy load routes that aren't immediately needed

### Optimization
- Optimize images before adding them
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Accessibility Requirements

### Must-Haves
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Images need alt text
- Form inputs need labels
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3...)
- Color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1

### Testing Accessibility
- Use browser dev tools accessibility checker
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Test with screen reader if possible

## Release Process

### Version Numbers
We use Semantic Versioning (semver):
- **1.0.0** - Major version (breaking changes)
- **1.1.0** - Minor version (new features)
- **1.1.1** - Patch version (bug fixes)

### Release Schedule
- **Patch releases** - As needed for critical bugs
- **Minor releases** - Monthly
- **Major releases** - When we have significant changes

## Community Guidelines

### Be Respectful
- Use inclusive language
- Be patient with newcomers
- Provide constructive feedback
- Assume good intentions

### Communication
- Use clear, specific language in issues
- Provide context for your requests
- Be responsive to feedback
- Say thank you!
